TODO:
0.1:
+ + calculate multiple routes and select the shortest : not optimized
+ add 'waypoints'
+ save layout to json
+  + create route description from path. ex: turn right, move straight ahead 4 squares, turn left... : temporary solution by storing direction to obj.directions
+ do not add start position to final solution before return;
+ set predefined directions to be called in recursive function before randomization
+ break from loop if path length is equal to actual distance
+ return the difference between the path lenght and the straight course length
+ learn from each iteration: if path to waypoint is bigger - return null - iterate until path is found
+ store solutions not null in array. if path length of the last n number of solutions is identical, break loop.
+ store the path including steps taken in solutions object

Done:
+ create ids for grid items with javascript
+ set start and end by clicking
+ paint path on mousedown
